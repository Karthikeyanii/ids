DDoS Attack Detection Using Machine Learning

Overview
This project aims to detect Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks using machine learning techniques. By analyzing network traffic patterns, the system identifies suspicious activities indicative of DDoS attacks and alerts administrators for further action.

Features
Machine Learning Models: Utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for detecting anomalies in network traffic.
Customizable Thresholds: Allows administrators to set customizable thresholds for defining normal and abnormal network behavior.
Scalable: Designed to handle large-scale networks and adapt to varying traffic loads.
Easy Integration: Can be easily integrated into existing network infrastructure.

Dataset
The system requires a labeled dataset of network traffic, containing examples of both normal and DDoS attack traffic, for training the machine learning model.

Usage
Configure the system by modifying the settings in config.py.
Train the machine learning model using labeled dataset.
Run the detection system
